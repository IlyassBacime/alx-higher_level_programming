This is a repo for Python - if/else, loops, functions, it includes the projects done in the alx software engineering programme

The different projects are as follows:

0) 0-positive_or_negative.py : Prints whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative

1) 1-last_digit.py : Prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable number

2) 2-print_alphabet.py : Writes a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase

3) 3-print_alphabt.py : Writes a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase

4) 4-print_hexa.py : Writes a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal

5) 5-print_comb2.py : Writes a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99

6) 6-print_comb3.py : Writes a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits

7) 7-islower.py : Writes a function that checks for lowercase character

8) 8-uppercase.py : Writes a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line

9) 9-print_last_digit.py : Writes a function that prints the last digit of a number

10) 10-add.py : Writes a function that adds two integers and returns the result

11) 11-pow.py : Writes a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value

12) 12-fizzbuzz.py : Writes a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space

13) 13-insert_number.c : Writes a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list

14) 100-print_tebahpla.py : Writes a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase

15) 101-remove_char_at.py : Writes a function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the “C array index”)

16) 102-magic_calculation.py : Writes the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b, c): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:
